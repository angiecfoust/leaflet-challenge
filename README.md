# Leaflet Challenge
Module 15 graded assignment
<hr>

## Background
The United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short, is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes.

The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. In this challenge, you have been tasked with developing a way to visualize USGS data that will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet.

## Assignment Requirements
1. Select a dataset from the USGS
2. Import and visualize the data by using leaflet to create a map of all earthquakes from the chosen dataset.
3. Data markers should be included to reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size (greater magnitude = larger size).
4. Data markes should also reflect the depth of the earthquake by their color (greater depth = darker color).
5. Include popups to provide additional information such as place, date, magnitude, and depth.
6. Create a legend.

## Sample Output
Below is a screenshot of a portion of the map created.
